\cvevent{Supervisor}{Aarhus University}{}{Aarhus, Denmark}

I have had the opportunity to supervise students in projects related to my research
project.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Anders Benjamin Clausen and Kent Nielsen}

  As part of their Bachelor's project in 2022 they investigated the possibility to 
  make a prior known algorithm for BDD variable reordering I/O-efficient.

\item \textbf{Anna Blume Jakobsen and Mathias Weller Berg Thomasen}

  In the summer after their first year on Bachelor's degree they implemented a
  prototype of what was to become the \emph{Adiar} project.
\end{itemize}
