I have, in collaboration with my supervisor Prof. Jaco van de Pol, designed \emph{I/O-efficient}
algorithms and data structures to make Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) scale beyond the limits of
the machine's available memory.

\medskip

As part of this work, these algorithms have been implemented, evaluated, and improved upon to create
a new BDD library in C++. Compared to other implementations, this work is thoroughly tested, is
almost as fast or faster, and has a more generic and user-friendly API.
